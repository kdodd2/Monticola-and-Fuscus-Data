# Monticola-and-Fuscus-Data
This is the data I will use for the project
I plan on doing simple descriptive statistics and creating a few frequency distributions for the inhibition data. For the 16S data, I will likely use multivariate stats to see how similar the microbial communities are (monticola vs. fuscus).
I have attached a paper that used statistics similar to what I plan to do
