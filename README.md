# Monticola-and-Fuscus-Data
This is the data I will use for the project
I plan on doing simple descriptive statistics and creating a few frequency distributions for the inhibition data. For the 16S data, I will likely use multivariate stats to see how similar the microbial communities are (monticola vs. fuscus). 
I am planning on testing the hypothesis that some bacteria produce anti-Bd metabolites and can inhibit Bd growth.
Response variable is microbial growth in the coculture assay. I am not sure what the predictor would be.
If I run a regular linear regression, an assumption is that the data has to be normally distributed. 
I have attached a paper that used statistics similar to what I plan to do
Most likely most bacteria will not be inhibitory, but some of them will be.
I am meeting with the head professor on this project this Friday, so hopefully I will understand more about this dataset and what kinds of tests should be done. Once I know, I will come back and edit this portion.
